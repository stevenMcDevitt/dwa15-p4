## Description
Synchronized Skating is a large and fast-growing discipline of figure skating where 8â€“20
(the number of skaters on a team depends on the level) skaters skate on ice as a team, 
moving as one flowing unit at high speeds with emphasis on maintaining precise formations
and timing of the group.

There are approximately 525 synchronized teams registered with the U.S. Figure Skating 
Association with nearly 5,000 athletes participating in annual synchronized skating 
sectional championships.

Numerous Figure Skating Clubs have multiple teams that compete at the various competition
levels.  Some clubs have over 200 skaters.

The purpose of this solution is to assist in the management of team rosters and to maintain
a database of skater, coach and team information.

## Demo
A demo and presentation will be provided in the in-person section.

## Details for Teaching Team
The solution includes some features that would not ordinarily be included.  Skater records
would not be deleted as there is a need to record the skating and team participation history
of each skater.

This solution is the beginning of a complete application that can be used to manage a large
skating club organization.

The demonstration database is populated with 250 skater records and a representative number of
skating team at various competition levels.  All of the CRUD activities are represented.
